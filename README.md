This course will focus on practical coding for research using Python and R. We will begin discussing the versioning tool Git, the command line, and downloading tools to begin coding with these languages. Then we will talk about how to use Jupyter notebooks and responsibly use AI to help with the coding process. Next, we will begin reading, writing, and analyzing data and images with Python. We will then shift to using R and RStudio. Beginning with how to organize a project, load and manage R packages, and set up the AI Copilot tool within RStudio.
